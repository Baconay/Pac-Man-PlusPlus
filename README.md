# Pac-Man-PlusPlus

Developed as our final project for CS211 at Northwestern, Pac-Man++ is a clone of the original Pac-Man game. Created in the GE-211 game engine, this verison of Pac-Man does come with its flaws, but functions according to our specifications. 

# Future Developments

We plan to implement smoother Pac-Man movement, real-time ghost AI, and procedurally generated maze levels using Eller's Algorithm.
