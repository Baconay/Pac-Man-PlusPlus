Specifications: 

1) The map is initially generated on the screen. 
    - Validation by playing: Run the game and see that the maze map appears on screen. 
   
2) The movement of the Pacman is controlled by the keyboard’s arrow keys  
    - Validation by playing: Run the game and press the arrow keys on the keyboard to see that the Pac-man moves in each cardinal direction. 
   
3) Ghost movements are in random pre-specified directions on the map. 
    - Validation by playing: Run the game and observe that the ghosts move in random directions at various junctions after making contact with a wall.
   
4) The Pacman has three lives, and each time a ghost touches it, the game resets and the life counter decrements. The life and score counter will be displayed as integers on the top right-hand corner of the screen. 
    - Validation by playing: Run the game and observe that there is a life and sore counter on the right-hand side of the screen. Move the Pac-man onto a ghost and observe that every sprite location is reset and the life counter decrements by 1. 
   
5) Ghosts can be eaten for a certain amount of time after the Pacman eats a power pellet, which is a normal pellet but enlarged in size visually. 
    - Validation by playing: Run the game and move the Pac-man onto an enlarged power pellet, observe that the ghosts turn vulnerable and move the Pac-man onto a ghost to eat them and observe the ghost teleport back into their spawn. 
   
6) Ghosts spawn and respawn in the center of the map during the start of the game and after they are eaten (after a certain amount of time). 
    - Validation by playing: Run the game and observe that ghosts spawn in the center of the map. Move the Pac-man onto a ghost after the Pac-man eats an enlarged power pellet to observe the ghost teleport back into their spawn and stay frozen for a couple seconds before it begins to move again. 
   
7) A new round begins if the Pacman eats all the pellets on one map. The score is carried over to the next round. The round number will also be displayed as an integer in the top right-hand corner of the screen. 
    - Validation by playing: Run the game and maneuver the Pac-man to eat every yellow pellet on the screen without losing all three lives in the process. Observe that a new map is drawn, sprite positions are reset, the score carries over from the last round, and the round counter increases by one. 

8) Each time the Pacman eats a ghost or a pellet, a score counter is updated 
    - Validation by playing: Run the game and move the Pac-man over small yellow pellets to observe that the score counter on the right-hand side increments. Have the Pac-man eat an enlarged power pellet and move the Pac-man over a ghost to observe that the ghost is eaten and the score counter on the right-hand side is incremented. 
   
9) If the Pacman hits a wall, it stops moving until an arrow key is pressed in a moveable direction. 
    - Validation by playing: Run the game and move the Pac-man using the arrow keys on the keyboard. Move the Pac-man into a wall and let go of the key on the keyboard. Observe that the Pac-man stops moving. 
    
10) The game’s mazes will be a set of at least 3 maps
    - Validation by playing: Run the game and type a number between 0-2 in the console when prompted. This will allow you to observe all three possible maps that are generated by the game. 

Favorite Model Tests:
 
Test 1: Power Pellet + Dying (Line 39)
    - Tests if the Pac-man can eat a power-pellet, and when eaten, tests if it can kill ghosts. 
    - Later on, the ghost touches the Pac-man more than 3 times and kills it. 

Test 2: Round Increments after Pellets Eaten (Line 126)
    - Tests that the round of the game will update once all the pellets are eaten. 
    - Checks to see if Pacman is reset to spawn point

Test 3: Pacman stops at walls (Line 170)
    - Tests if the Pac-man stops when it hits a wall.
    - Checks to see if the Pac-man stays in the same location after hitting a wall
  
Test 4: Score Increasing (Line 195)
    - Tests to see if the score increments from completing the following actions:
    - Eating a pellet
    - Eating a power pellet
    - Eating a ghost

Test 5: Pac-man dies, Game over (Line 268)
    - Tests to see if the game ends once all of Pac-man's lives run out. 
    - Once lives < 3, the game is over.
